- Fixed memory leaks in image processing
- Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Improved error handling and logging
- **MAJOR UPDATE (2025-07-17)**: Fixed critical GUI threading issues and responsiveness problems

### ✅ RESOLVED - All Critical Issues Fixed (2025-07-17)

## Summary of Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Fixed Cancel Button Not Working During Gmail Download
**Root Cause**: Gmail API calls were blocking operations that didn't check cancellation frequently enough.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `cancel_check` parameter to `get_email_details()` and `download_attachment()` methods in `src/gmail/processor.py`
- Added cancellation checks before and after each Gmail API call
- Added multiple cancellation checkpoints throughout the attachment processing loop in `src/gmail/downloader.py`
- Enhanced logging to show exactly when and where cancellation occurs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gmail/processor.py`: Added cancel_check parameters and cancellation logic to API methods
- `src/gmail/downloader.py`: Added extensive cancellation checks in email and attachment processing loops

### 2. ✅ Fixed Cancel Button Not Working During KB File Processing
**Root Cause**: File processing loops and PDF conflict dialogs didn't respect cancellation events.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added cancellation checks before every major file operation (validation, copying/moving, PDF creation)
- Enhanced PDF conflict dialogs to periodically check for cancellation and auto-close if cancelled
- Added cancellation checks during image loading and PDF generation
- Proper resource cleanup when cancellation occurs during image processing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/kb/processor.py`: Added comprehensive cancellation checks throughout file processing workflow

### 3. ✅ Fixed Progress Text Clearing Problem
**Root Cause**: The double-set approach (space then empty) was ineffective for clearing progress text.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created robust `clear_progress_text()` method using multiple clearing strategies:
  - Unique placeholder text method
  - Widget reconfiguration
  - Pack/unpack to force visual refresh
- Replaced all instances of the old clearing method with the new robust approach

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gui/main_window.py`: Added `clear_progress_text()` method and updated all progress clearing locations

## Comprehensive Testing Completed:

### ✅ Syntax and Import Validation
- All modified Python files pass syntax validation
- All imports work correctly
- No breaking changes introduced

### ✅ Cancellation Logic Testing
- Threading.Event cancellation mechanism verified working
- Both Gmail and KB processors correctly respond to cancellation events
- Proper state management confirmed

### ✅ Integration Testing
- App startup and initialization works correctly
- No regression in existing functionality
- All components properly connected

## Technical Details:

### Cancellation Implementation Strategy
1. **Frequent Checkpoint Pattern**: Added cancellation checks at all critical points in processing loops
2. **API Wrapper Pattern**: Modified Gmail API calls to accept and use cancel_check callbacks
3. **Resource Cleanup Pattern**: Ensured proper cleanup of resources (file handles, images) when cancellation occurs
4. **Dialog Cancellation Pattern**: Made modal dialogs responsive to cancellation events

### Progress Text Clearing Strategy
1. **Multi-method Approach**: Uses three different clearing techniques for maximum reliability
2. **Unique Placeholder**: Uses distinctive text that won't match existing content
3. **Widget Refresh**: Forces complete visual refresh of the progress label

### Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed cancellation logging to track exactly where and when cancellation occurs
- Improved error handling and reporting throughout the cancellation flow

## Files Modified Summary:
- `src/gmail/processor.py` - Enhanced with cancellation-aware API methods
- `src/gmail/downloader.py` - Added comprehensive cancellation checkpoints
- `src/kb/processor.py` - Implemented thorough cancellation support in file processing
- `src/gui/main_window.py` - Fixed progress text clearing and updated cancellation flow

### 4. ✅ Fixed Critical GUI Freezing and Threading Issues (2025-07-17)
**Root Cause**: All long-running operations were executing in the main GUI thread, causing the application to freeze when window lost focus, during processing, or when cancel was pressed.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Background Threading**: Moved entire processing workflow (`run_processing_workflow()`) to background thread
- **Thread-Safe GUI Updates**: All GUI updates now use `self.root.after(0, ...)` to execute safely on main thread
- **Non-Blocking Progress Updates**: Progress bar and status text updates are scheduled on main thread
- **Thread-Safe Cleanup**: Success, error, and cancellation handling all execute safely on main thread
- **Responsive Cancel**: Cancel button now works immediately without blocking GUI

**Technical Implementation**:
- `start_processing()` starts background thread with `threading.Thread(target=self.run_processing_workflow, daemon=True)`
- `update_progress()`, `update_status()`, `gui_update()` - All made thread-safe with `root.after()` scheduling
- `_finalize_processing_success()`, `_finalize_processing_error()`, `_cleanup_after_cancel_safe()` - Safe completion handlers
- `_handle_no_emails_found()` - Thread-safe no results handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gui/main_window.py`: Complete threading architecture overhaul
- `src/gmail/downloader.py`: Enhanced cancellation support for file conflict dialogs
- `src/kb/processor.py`: Path normalization fixes for Excel file handling

**Benefits Achieved**:
