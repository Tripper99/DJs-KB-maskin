- Added cancellation checks before every major file operation (validation, copying/moving, PDF creation)
- Enhanced PDF conflict dialogs to periodically check for cancellation and auto-close if cancelled
- Added cancellation checks during image loading and PDF generation
- Proper resource cleanup when cancellation occurs during image processing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/kb/processor.py`: Added comprehensive cancellation checks throughout file processing workflow

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Progress Text Clearing Problem
**Root Cause**: The double-set approach (space then empty) was ineffective for clearing progress text.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created robust `clear_progress_text()` method using multiple clearing strategies:
  - Unique placeholder text method
  - Widget reconfiguration
  - Pack/unpack to force visual refresh
- Replaced all instances of the old clearing method with the new robust approach

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gui/main_window.py`: Added `clear_progress_text()` method and updated all progress clearing locations
